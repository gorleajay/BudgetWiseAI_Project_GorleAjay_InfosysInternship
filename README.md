#  BudgetWise AI – Expense Forecasting Tool  
### Developed as part of the **Infosys Springboard Internship (2025)**  
**Author:** Gorle Ajay  

---

##  Project Overview

**BudgetWise AI** is an intelligent financial management and expense forecasting system designed to help users track their spending, set budgets, analyze trends, and predict future expenses using advanced machine learning models.  
The system integrates a clean **Streamlit web interface**, secure **SQLite storage**, interactive **data visualizations**, and optimized **AI models** (CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ensemble).

This project demonstrates real-world implementation of **AI/ML**, **model training**, **frontend dashboards**, **backend logic**, and **end-to-end deployment**.
